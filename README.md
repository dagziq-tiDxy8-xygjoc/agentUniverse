## What is agentUniverse?

**agentUniverse is a multi-agent framework based on large language models.** It provides flexible and easily extensible capabilities for building individual agents. The core of agentUniverse is a rich set of multi-agent collaborative pattern components (serving as a collaborative pattern factory), which allows agents to perform their respective duties and maximize their capabilities when solving problems in different fields; at the same time, agentUniverse focuses on the integration of domain experience, helping you smoothly integrate domain experience into the work of intelligent agents.üéâüéâüéâ

**üåàüåàüåàagentUniverse originates from the real-world financial business practices of AntGroup (https://github.com/antgroup), dedicated to assisting developers and enterprises in effortlessly constructing domain-expert-level intelligent agents that collaborate to accomplish tasks.**


![](docs/guidebook/_picture/agent_universe_framework_resize.jpg)

We look forward to your practice and communication and sharing of Patterns in different fields through the community. This framework has already placed many useful components that have been tested in real business scenarios in terms of multi-agent cooperation, and will continue to be enriched in the future.
The pattern components that are currently open for use include:

* PEER pattern component: This pattern uses agents with different responsibilities‚ÄîPlan, Execute, Express, and Review‚Äîto break down complex problems into manageable steps, execute the steps in sequence, and iteratively improve based on feedback, enhancing the performance of reasoning and analysis tasks. Typical use cases: Event interpretation, industry analysis.
* DOE pattern component: This pattern employs three agents‚ÄîData-fining, Opinion-inject, and Express‚Äîto improve the effectiveness of tasks that are data-intensive, require high computational precision, and incorporate expert opinions. Typical use cases: Financial report generation.

More patterns are coming soon...

The LLM model integration can be accomplished with simple configuration, currently agentUniverse supported models include:

Overview: This document introduces in detailed the mechanisms and principles underlying the PEER multi-agent framework. The experimental section assigned scores across seven dimensions: completeness, relevance, conciseness, factualness, logicality, structure, and comprehensiveness, with a maximum score of 5 points for each dimension. On average, the PEER model scored higher in each evaluation dimension compared to BabyAGI, and show notable advantages particularly in completeness, relevance, logicality, structure, and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, when tested with the GPT-3.5 Turbo (16k) model, the PEER model achieved a superior accuracy rate of 83% compared to BabyAGI, and with the GPT-4 model, it achieved an accuracy rate of 81%. For more details, please refer to the document.

## How to build an agent application

### Standard Project Scaffolding
Setup the standard project: [agentUniverse Standard Project](examples/sample_standard_app)

#### Quick Start for Building a Single Agent
You can learn how to quickly build a single agent by reading the [Quick Guide to Build Single Agent](docs/guidebook/en/Get_Start/3.Quick_Guide_to_Build_Single_Agent.md). This will help you understand how to enhance your agent's capabilities using tools, knowledge bases, RAG technologies, and more. Additionally, you will grasp the basic application development processes for agents, including configuration, testing, optimizing, deployment, and performance evaluation. 

#### Building Typical Multi-Agent Applications
You can further understand how to break down intelligent capabilities into multiple agents in complex task scenarios and enhance your task performance through collaboration by referring to the [Building Typical Multi-Agent App](docs/guidebook/en/Get_Start/4.Building_Typical_Multi-Agent_App.md) chapter.

#### Creating and Using Agent Templates
You can learn how to create effective agent patterns into templates through the chapter [Creating and Using Agent Templates](docs/guidebook/en/Get_Start/5.Creating_and_Using_Agent_Templates.md). This will greatly enhance the efficiency of constructing subsequent agents and facilitate dissemination.

#### Common Tips and Advanced Techniques
You can learn more advanced techniques in the agent application building process through other documents in the [Get_Start](./docs/guidebook/en/Get_Start), such as how to add a memory module into the intelligent agent process and how to effectively manage prompts within the project.

## Why use agentUniverse

### Concept
![](docs/guidebook/_picture/agentuniverse_structure_en.png)

The core of agentUniverse provides all the essential components needed to build a single intelligent agent, the collaboration mechanisms between multiple agents, and allows for the injection of expert knowledge. The enables developers to effortlessly create intelligent applications equipped with professional know-how.

### Multi Agent Collaboration
AgentUniverse offers several multi-agent collaboration model components that have been validated in real-world industries. Among these, the "PEER" model stands out as one of the most distinctive.

The PEER model utilizes agents with four distinct responsibilities: Planning, Executing, Expressing, and Reviewing. This structure allows for the decomposition and step-by-step execution of complex problems and enables autonomous iteration based on evaluation feedback, ultimately enhancing performance in reasoning and analytical tasks. This model is particularly effective in scenarios that require multi-step decomposition and in-depth analysis, such as event interpretation, macroeconomic analysis, and the feasibility analysis of business proposals.

The PEER model has achieved impressive results, and the latest research findings and experimental data can be found in the following literature.

### Key Features
Based on the above introduction, we summarize the main features of agentUniverse as follow:

Flexible and Extensible Agent Construction Capability: It provides all the essential components necessary for building agents, all of which support customization to tailor user-specific agents.

Rich and Effective Multi-Agent Collaboration Models: It offers collaborative models such as PEER (Plan/Execute/Express/Review) and DOE (Data-finding/Opinion-inject/Express), which have been validated in the industry. Users can also customize and orchestrate new models to facilitate organic collaboration among multiple agents.

Easy Integration of Domain Expertise: It offers capabilities for domain prompts, knowledge construction, and management, enabling the orchestration and injection of domain-level SOPs, aligning agents with expert-level domain knowledge.
